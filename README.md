Carbon fiber plate
==================

If you go to <https://www.pcbway.com/rapid-prototyping/manufacture/> and select _Sheet Metal_, you can see the standard sizes supported for aluminum and carbon fiber.

They are: 0.8mm, 1mm, 1.2mm, 1.5mm, 2mm, 3mm and 4mm for both materials.

Convert the `outline` SVGs into PDF and price them up for laser cutting - i.e. the _Sheet Metal_ tab.

Convert the `filled` SVGs to `.step` files in the various thicknesses 1mm to 2mm.

Your grommets are the 5mm ones shown here: <https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/H1cb5137fbecc4d2fb344202ec5ad5f5aQ.jpg>

I.e. they require a 7mm hole in the carbon fiber and require a 2mm thick sheet, the grommet's inner diameter is 5mm.

Price up for carbon fiber and aluminum.

Look at adding holes for mounting goBILDA parts.
